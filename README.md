# Introduction

## What is Resmo?

[Resmo](https://www.resmo.com) offers cloud-native teams a comprehensive solution for continuous cyber asset visibility and security. By enabling SQL-based data queries across a range of Cloud and SaaS providers, including AWS, GCP, Atlassian Stack, Okta, Google Workspace, and more, Resmo empowers customers to stay on top of changes. Through consolidation of users, vulnerabilities, repositories, and other key constructs, Resmo provides valuable insights through user-friendly dashboards and automates compliance checks for common frameworks like CIS benchmarks, alerting customers to potential security vulnerabilities.

Resmo was born out of a need. Companies are moving to the Cloud rapidly and building their entire operations on Cloud providers and SaaS tools. Their modern stack gets complex and crowded quickly. Account and asset creations are automated. Each user gets her own account on the cloud. Every user, every repository, every bucket, every resource/asset quickly accumulates technical debt and becomes a source of vulnerabilities. In these complex environments, static checks canâ€™t catch all the required threads in time. Teams responsible for security and compliance have a hard time getting visibility into changes made in Cloud and SaaS tools across the company. At Resmo, we help modern teams solve these challenges.
