Resmo integrates with Webflow to help you keep your assets visible, secure, and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Webflow users?

* Collect Webflow resources like access groups, domains, and sites in one place.
* Query your asset, configurations, and changes using the SQL query engine or free-text search
* Set up security and compliance rules for automated security checks
* Receive timely notifications when there is a critical rule change

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.

#### Available resources

Resmo aggregates Webflow resources, including domains, access groups, and webhooks.
