<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/qualys-logo.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Resmo seamlessly integrates with your Qualys account to help you keep your resources and configurations visible, secure, and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Qualys users?

* Collect your Qualys resources like users, findings, and compliance scans in one place.
* Query your Qualys assets and keep track of every single change.
* Set up security rules to continuously evaluate your security posture.
* Receive timely notifications about resource and configuration changes.

### How does the integration work?

Once you sign up to Resmo, you can easily integrate your account with Qualys using the API URL of your account and your user credentials.

* The Qualys API URL you should use for API requests depends on the Qualys platform where your account is located.
  * You can check the following resources to get your account URL:
    * [URL API Server](https://qualysguard.qg2.apps.qualys.com/portal-help/en/assetview/api\_doc/online/get\_started/url\_api\_server.htm)
    * [Platform Identification](https://www.qualys.com/platform-identification/)

{% hint style="info" %}
The integration uses your username and password to authenticate with Qualys API. Please be careful to use a user with the following permissions:

* Compliance Scan List
* Host List Detection
* User List
* KnowledgeBase
* Search Web Application
* Search Web Application Scans
* Search Web Application Findings
* Search Host Assets
{% endhint %}
