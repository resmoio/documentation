Resmo integrates with Trello to keep your assets, like boards and members, visible, secure, and compliant in one place.

### What does Resmo offer to Trello users?

* Collect your directory assets like members, boards, power-ups, and organizations from your Trello account.
* Query your Trello resources using the powerful SQL query engine or free text search.
* Automate security checks with custom and managed rules.
* Set up rule notifications based on Trello resource configurations.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time through regular polling.
