<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/drata-wordmark-black.svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Resmo collects and visualizes the configuration data of your Drata workspaces, monitors, monitoring controls, controls, and personnel, as well as any change that occurs, to alert in time and reinforce your security and compliance operations.&#x20;

### What does Resmo offer to Drata users?

* See the details of each Drata workspace, including its name, description, and associated personnel.
* Check the number of implemented controls within each Drata with their specific attributes and statuses.
* List the personnel information associated with Drata, including their roles, responsibilities, and contact details.
* Set up automated checks for changes and vulnerabilities.
* Receive real-time alerts for security rules.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing Drata resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.
