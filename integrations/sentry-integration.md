<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/sentry-logo.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Resmo integrates with Sentry to keep your resources and configurations secure and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Sentry users?

* Collect directory assets like users, teams, projects, and integrations from your Sentry account.
* Query your Sentry resources using SQL or Free Text search.
* Set up custom security rules or use predefined ones to improve your security posture.
* Get real-time notifications when there's a change in your security rule status.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.

#### Available resources

Resmo consolidates Sentry resources in a single asset inventory, including Integrations, Organizations, Users, and Teams.
