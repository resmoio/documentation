# Confluence Integration

## Resmo + Confluence Integration Fundamentals

![](../.gitbook/assets/confluence-logo.png)

Resmo integrates with Jira to help you protect your issues and project from potential risks and stay secure and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Confluence users?

* Gather all your Confluence resources in one place
* Query your assets using a streamlined SQL query engine
* Track change histories of your assets
* Set up rules to audit your resource compliance automatically
* Receive alerts on rule violations to accelerate response times

### How does the integration work?

Resmo integrates with Confluence through the OAuth 2.0 app. Once you hit the Create button on the Resmo Confluence integration page, you will be redirected to the OAuth page. After you accept the permissions, you can start querying Confluence assets on your Resmo account.

Resmo operates the resource receiving and regular data-update collection processes through API polling.&#x20;
