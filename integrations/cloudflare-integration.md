## Resmo + Cloudflare Integration Fundamentals

![](../.gitbook/assets/cf-logo-v-rgb.png)

Resmo integrates with Cloudflare to ensure the security and compliance of your Cloudflare assets.

### What does Resmo offer to Cloudflare users?

* Consolidate and monitor all your Cloudflare assets on a single platform.
* Query your Cloudflare users, zones, DNS records, user memberships, accounts, and more.
* Set up rules to continuously assess your Cloudflare resources.
* Receive notifications when there is a rule violation.

### How does the integration work?

Once you sign up to Resmo, you can easily integrate your account with Cloudflare using an API token. Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time through regular polling.

Cloudflare API tokens are generated from the User Profile>API Tokens page. The token requires permission to read all resources. You may also use the 'Read all resources' token template as demonstrated below.

### Troubleshooting

* Please check your API token permissions if you cannot see your resources even if the integration is successfully configured.
* Cloudflare requires the Enterprise plan to [list all invitations](https://api.cloudflare.com/#user-s-invites-list-invitations) associated with a user. Without the Cloudflare Enterprise plan, Resmo cannot collect user invitation resources from your account. Other resources can be collected.
