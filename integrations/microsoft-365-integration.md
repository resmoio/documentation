Resmo's Microsoft integration provides comprehensive email activity analysis, efficient file access tracking, and detailed assessment of meeting and application usage. Furthermore, it enables robust security monitoring, ensuring a safe and productive Microsoft 365 environment for your organization.

### What does Resmo offer to Microsoft 365 users?

* Monitor SharePoint Online activities for enhanced collaboration and optimal access control&#x20;
* Analyze email activity on Exchange Online with Resmo to improve email management practices.&#x20;
* Assess meeting habits and efficiency using Resmo's meeting activity data analytics.
* Track application usage across Microsoft 365 services to maximize productivity and identify training opportunities.
* Ensure robust security and compliance monitoring by tracking security-related events.

### How does the integration work?

Currently, the Microsoft 365 integration supports the [Audit Logs](broken-reference) feature only. Upon successfully integrating the system, you gain the ability to conveniently access and review system activities associated with your Microsoft 365 account through the dedicated Audit Logs page.

This allows you to collect and analyze activity logs from various Microsoft services such as OneNote, SharePoint, Exchange, and Outlook.
