Resmo's one-click integration with Zoom allows you to monitor and secure your assets in a single platform.

### What does Resmo offer to Zoom users?

* Collect your directory assets like users, roles, and groups from your Zoom account.
* Query your resources using SQL or free text search.
* Set up automated security and compliance checks for your Zoom assets.
* Receive timely notifications when there is a vulnerability or rule violation.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect your existing Zoom resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.

#### Available resources

Resources you can collect with the integration include the following:

* Users
* Roles
* Groups
* Account Settings
* Account Lock Settings
