Resmo seamlessly integrates with Zendesk to help keep your assets visible, secure, and compliant in real time.

### What does Resmo offer to Zendesk users?

* Collect your directory assets like users, tokens, and groups from your Zendesk account.
* Query your Zendesk users, tokens, apps, groups, and much more.
* Set up security rules based on Zendesk resource configurations.
* Get notified when there is a critical change in your security and compliance rules.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo has a Zendesk application that you can install once you sign up for a Resmo account. Our application uses API to make the initial polling and receive existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time through regular polling.
