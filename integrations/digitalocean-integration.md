Resmo integrates with DigitalOcean to make sure your DigitalOcean environment is safe and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to DigitalOcean users?

* Collect your directory assets, like CDN endpoints, apps, firewalls, certificates, and more, on a single platform.
* Query your DigitalOcean app, domain, domain records, Kubernetes clusters, and more using SQL and free text search.
* Set up automated security rules to evaluate your DigitalOcean asset security posture.
* Get near real-time notifications of security rule violations to avoid vulnerabilities in time.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through regular polling.
