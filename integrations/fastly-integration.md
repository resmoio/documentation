<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/fastly-logo copy.svg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Resmo seamlessly integrates with your Fastly account to help you secure your cyber asset environment.

### What does Resmo offer to Fastly users?

* Collect all your Fastly assets, such as API Tokens, users, and services, in one place.
* Query your Fastly users, services, account, and much more.
* Set up rule notifications based on Fastly resource configurations
* Automatically audit resources' conformance with your security rules

### How does the integration work?

Once you sign up to Resmo, you can easily integrate your account with Fastly using an API Token and Customer ID.

* The **Customer ID** can be obtained from\
  [https://manage.fastly.com/account/company](https://manage.fastly.com/account/company)
* The **API Token** can be created from\
  [https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens](https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens)
  * API Token must have Read-only access (global:read)
  * Be careful with service selection while creating API Token. If you select a service, Resmo will collect data for only that service.

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time by regular polling.

#### Available resources

Resmo aggregates Fastly resources in real-time, including accounts, API Tokens, and services, allowing you to query and secure your cyber assets.
