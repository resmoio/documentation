Resmo integrates with your Intercom account in one click, allowing you to collect and secure your Intercom resources and configurations in one place.

### What does Resmo offer to Intercom users?

* Be instantly alerted of any additions or removals of administrators within your team.&#x20;
* Stay informed about any changes in team assignments with real-time notifications.
* Set up custom rules and run custom SQL queries to improve asset visibility.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing Intercom resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.
