![](../.gitbook/assets/synk-logo.png)

Resmo integrates with Snyk to ensure your Snyk environment is safe and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Snyk users?

* Consolidate and visualize all Snyk resources in one place
* Query your resources like integrations, dependencies, issues, and members
* Continuously assess your assets and configurations for vulnerabilities
* Set up notification rules to get alerted on rule violations
* Utilize conformance packs to run compliance diagnoses across your resources&#x20;

### How does the integration work?

Once you sign up to Resmo, you can easily integrate your account with Snyk using an API key. Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time by regular polling.
