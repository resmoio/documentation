DocuSign can easily be integrated with Resmo to maintain your assets' security, compliance, and visibility.

### What does Resmo offer to DocuSign users?

* Collect your directory assets like users, groups, and organizations from your DocuSign account.
* Query your DocuSign users, groups, organizations, and more.
* Set up custom security rules and run custom SQL queries to improve your asset visibility.
* Visualize your resource security using graph view or dashboards.
* Receive timely notifications of critical security rule changes.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.
