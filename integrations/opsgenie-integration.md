# Opsgenie Integration

## Resmo + Opsgenie Integration Fundamentals

![](../.gitbook/assets/Opsgenie-logo.png)

Resmo integrates with Opsgenie to make sure your configurations and assets are secure and compliant.

### What does Resmo offer to Opsgenie users?

* Query your Opsgenie resources like integrations, escalations, teams, and more with SQL.
* Automated configuration audits based on predefined or custom rules.
* See change histories and actors of configurations.
* Get notified in real-time when a rule is violated.
* Consolidate and monitor all cloud and SaaS assets in one place.

{% hint style="info" %}
Opsgenie is also available as a notification channel.&#x20;

See [Opsgenie Notification Channel](../notifications/opsgenie-notification-channel.md).
{% endhint %}

### How does the integration work?

Resmo connects with Opsgenie through a Configuration & Read-Only API key. The API key enables the initial polling and consolidating of existing Opsgenie resources. Then, Resmo performs regular polling to receive resource changes and updates in real-time.

### Available resources

Resmo Opsgenie integration aggregates users, teams, escalations, accounts, schedules, and more.

See the full list:

### Common queries and rules
