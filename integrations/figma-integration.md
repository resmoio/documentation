Secure your Figma projects and other assets with the power of continuous visibility, security, and compliance.

### What does Resmo offer to Figma users?

* Collect and monitor your Figma assets on a single platform.
* Query your Figma users, projects, and more using SQL or free text search.
* Set up security rules to continuously assess your Figma resources.
* Receive notifications when there is a critical rule change.

### How does the integration work?

Once you sign up to Resmo, you can easily integrate your account with Figma using an account with the required privileges. Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Then, we receive resource changes and updates in real-time through regular polling.
