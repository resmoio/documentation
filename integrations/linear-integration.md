Resmo integrates with Linear in one click to bring complete visibility, security, and compliance into your environment.

### What does Resmo offer to Linear users?

* Collect your directory assets like users, teams, and projects from your Linear account.
* Query your Linear users, teams, projects, and more using SQL or free text search.
* Set up custom security rules and run custom SQL queries to improve your asset visibility.
* Get notified of critical security rule violations in near real-time.

### How does the integration work?

Resmo uses API to do the initial polling and collect existing resources. Following the initial polling, it receives updates and changes in real-time through webhook and regular polling.
