### Credit card charges

Your billing period starts the day you upgrade your account to a paid subscription plan.&#x20;

* For monthly plan subscriptions, you will be charged the monthly price to come on that day.
* Annual subscriptions require you to pay once a year for the plan you will use. Resmo offers discounts on annual payments.&#x20;
