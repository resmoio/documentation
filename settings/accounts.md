# Accounts

Once a user registers to Resmo, an account is automatically created. Users can have access to multiple accounts.&#x20;

### How to open your Account Information page

The Account Information page shows your account name and subdomain name.&#x20;

1. Log in to your Resmo account.
2. Then, go to your Settings page by clicking the gear icon from the upper right corner.
3. See the Account section from the left side panel.

### Account deletion

The owner user of an account can delete it from Setting>Account Information>Delete Account. The account will be automatically deleted a week after the deletion request.
