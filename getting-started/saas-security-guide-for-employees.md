# SaaS Security Guide for Employees

### Overview

Resmo safeguards your digital workspace by identifying authorized/unauthorized SaaS applications used and security vulnerabilities in those. It streamlines the process of ensuring digital safety and simplifies compliance with security best practices.

**Resmo operates discreetly in the background, alerting you only when it detects issues like:**

* Weak, shared, or reused passwords in work-related apps.
* Insecure configurations risking data exposure.
* Lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA) on accounts.

When Resmo identifies a security vulnerability, it communicates actionable, easy-to-understand advice through ChatOps tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams, and via direct browser notifications, based on your organization's setup. Actions to mitigate risks are often just a click away.

Resmo also aids your security team by maintaining an inventory of apps accessed with work credentials, covering a wide range from productivity tools to specialized software handling sensitive data. This ensures your company data is managed securely.

Furthermore, Resmo identifies potentially risky or untrustworthy apps in use, enabling your security team to address them effectively.

This proactive approach helps protect not only the organization but also its stakeholders, like customers or clients, from the repercussions of data breaches.

### How Does it Work?

Resmo utilizes various methods, including a browser extension, to monitor employee logins to online work accounts. It focuses solely on work-related accounts and does not interfere with personal accounts.

Should Resmo detect a security issue with these logins, it flags them to your security team. If configured, Resmo can also directly interact with employees via ChatOps to guide them in resolving these issues.

Resmo integrates seamlessly with your company’s primary work platforms, like Azure Active Directory or Google Workspace. This integration and the Chrome browser extension enable your IT team to:

* Identify the range of SaaS applications in use within your organization.
* Monitor for usage of weak or repeated passwords.
* Flag instances of excessive access rights.
* Strengthen the overall security framework of your SaaS environment.
* Let your team proactively address and resolve security issues.

When necessary, Resmo’s ChatOps feature may prompt you to enable MFA, strengthen your password, or review the relevance of older third-party integrations.

### Privacy and Security

We prioritize the protection of your data and commit to transparency in how we collect and use your information within our service. Your privacy is a top priority at Resmo. Rest assured, the extension does not track your browsing habits nor does it transmit any personal data, such as passwords.
