# SaaS Discovery Employees Dashboard

The SaaS Discovery dashboard is where you can monitor employee SaaS usage and security issues in one place. This page also shows employee browsers and employees without extensions.&#x20;

## Sending browser extension installation link to employees

1. Click on the Employees without Extensions number from the related card. Or click the Extensions filter and select Not Enrolled. This will list employees without the Resmo browser extension.&#x20;
2. See the Actions column and click the three dots on an employee's row. Then, send the installation link.&#x20;
3. You can send the installation link in bulk from SaaS Discovery > Apps Dashboard > Configure button on the top right of the page > select either:

* Copy Installation Link to send manually
* MDM Installation Guides (Mobile Device Management) to ensure that all employees have the browser extension installed.
* Send Installation Link to Everyone (everyone from your directory integration)
* [See browser extension installation](saas-discovery.md#installing-the-browser-extension).
