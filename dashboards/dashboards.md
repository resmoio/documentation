# Dashboards

### How do Resmo dashboards work?

Resmo dashboards pull existing data from the queries you defined for your widgets. The charts, tables, bars, and all widgets update near real-time.

The number of widgets must be a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 20.

* **Supported widget types:** area, bar, billboard, line, markdown, pie, table, and JSON.

### What do dashboards offer for Resmo users?

* Use templates to add a dashboard right away
* Create a custom dashboard from scratch&#x20;
* Visually monitor your resource changes
* Turn managed or saved queries into widgets for your dashboards
* Pick a query from your query history to add as a widget
* Monitor all users matched with your integrated clouds and applications

### Users dashboard

The Users dashboard on your Dashboards page allows you to easily monitor unique users by applications with some cool additional info like:

* Each unique user matched with applications
* Rules that apply to the user with status information so that you can take faster action
* Risk level on each unique user row
* Ability to see if a user is active or passive
* MFA and admin information of each user
* A table displaying users count per application
* Filterable results

{% hint style="info" %}
To see the active/passive, type, MFA, admin, and last sign-in info, expand each user row.
{% endhint %}
