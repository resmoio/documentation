# Tag Rules

With the automatic tagging feature, you can create "**tag rules**" to tag your resources automatically based on specified criteria. This eliminates the need for manual work and simplifies filtering and categorizing resources.

{% hint style="info" %}
Resource Groups are no longer needed and have been removed.
{% endhint %}

Resmo offers two different types of resource tagging:

[**Manual Tagging**](manual-tagging.md): To manually tag a resource, navigate to Explore > Resources, click on a resource to view its details, and then click +Add Tag on the right side to select and add tags to the resource.

### **Auto-Tagging**

Auto-tagging allows you to create Tag Rules that automatically filter resources matching the configurations you set and then apply the appropriate tags to those resources.

### Configuring a Tag Rule

1. Navigate to the Settings page and click on **Tags** under Configurations in the left sidebar. Click the **Add Tag Rule** button to start configuring a new rule.

4. Fill out the configuration settings. You can add multiple configurations for a single Tag Rule. Options include:

* Selecting an integration. If you don't select any, all integrations will be used.
* Using labeled integrations to filter resources.
* Selecting individual resource types for your tag rule.

5. Choose from the most common fields based on the selected integrations and resources, or add a custom value to refer to inner fields. You can add multiple fields to a single Tag Rule.
6. Click the **Create** button, and your Tag Rule is now active!
