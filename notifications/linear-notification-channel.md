# Linear Notification Channel

### How do Linear notification channels work?

By configuring a Linear notification channel, Resmo asks you to specify a Linear team and a project. Once you have set up the Linear channel and chosen it for alerts, Resmo will automatically create issues on your Linear account based on the team and project you have specified. This ensures you are promptly notified of any rule violations in real-time.

### How to set up a Linear notification channel

1. Go to Settings and click on Notification Channels.
2. Add Linear.
