# Email Notification Channel

### How do email notifications work?

Once you set up an email notification channel, Resmo sends automated notification/alert emails only when there is a violation against the notification rules you connected to the channel. Users can set up separate email notification channels for different notification rules.

* Notifications are sent in near real-time.
* Multiple emails can be added to an email notification channel.
* To connect a notification rule to a notification channel, you must select the channel on the individual notification rule page.
