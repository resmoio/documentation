# Parny Notification Channel

### How do Parny notification channels work?

Once you set up a Parny notification channel, you will be able to receive alert notifications from Resmo on your connected app. This way, you will be notified of any rule violations near real-time.

* To connect a notification rule to a notification channel, you must select the channel on the individual notification rule page.
